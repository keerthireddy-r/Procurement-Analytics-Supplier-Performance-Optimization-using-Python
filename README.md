# 📊 Procurement Analytics & Supplier Performance Project

## 📌 Overview
Analyzed **777 Purchase Orders** using Python to understand **spend trends, supplier performance, lead time, defects, savings, and compliance**. Built supplier scorecards and extracted insights to improve procurement efficiency.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook 

## ✅ Key Work Done
- Spend Trend (Month/Quarter/Year)
- Price Trend Over Time
- Supplier Scorecards (OTD%, Defect%, Compliance%, Lead Time)
- Savings Analysis & Risky Supplier Detection
- Insights & Recommendations

## 📊 Key Insights
- Spend shows **month & quarter fluctuations**
- Avg **savings ~8% per PO**
- Some suppliers have **high defects & low OTD%** → risk
